With due respect 

this email is regarding 

I a bibek poudel from Nepal. I have just graduated from Islington College, Kathmandu, affiliation with london metropolitan university. I have done my BSc(Hons) computing with artificial intelligence with first class hoonours with excellent results in AI related modules specially. My final year project was related to vision language model and intersection between the computer vision and language models for better understanding the environment and scenes.  I am very interested in multimodal learning, continual learning and vision language models for further advancement of this technology and social wellbeing, making earth a peaceful place to live.I followed your work, even though you haven't specifically worked in vision language models but your work in multimodal learning, multi-modal datasets, intersection of vision and language which closely align with my research interest as well. I am also highly disciplined, hardworking and attentive individual with natural curiosity of learning and reflect that learning with implementation, a real world impact instead of accumulation and learning. I belive in system and process but also strongly believe that randomness is also a huge aspect which we cannot overlook upon for innovation and advancements. I want to further continue mystudy in this field along with supporting my family financially. Its my responsibiltiy to take care of them being a only son of my parents with a younger sister whose responsibility is also on me. I am planning to applying to chapel hill university and preparing for my IELTS examination for english proficiency score as university criteria. Coming from financially poor family, i won't be able to afford the study cost there at states which come as major hindrance between my dream, my interest and my background,reality and maybe being born in poor family. I want to ask about any hiring or roles in your lab at university where I can contribute to as a intern or assistanship. I cannot support the study cost in such reputed institution with what I have and what I can afford. Such roles would greatly help me in my mission. I have attached my CV,SoR and SoP with this email. Apology for the long email but I wanted to reach out to you. I found about you through ranjay's work in molmo and pixmo i have read your works like not_all_unlabelled_are_...., 3d_spatial. 


Add  about my prior work and experience through the documents I have provided in this  chat. 


Dear Professor Jason, 

My name is Bibek Poudel. I recently graduated with First Class Honours in Computing with AI from Islington College, London Metropolitan University. As someone deeply engaged in the development of vision-language systems on edge devices, I’ve found great inspiration in your work on multimodal learning and its applications.

I grew up in a rural part of Nepal where access to technology was minimal. I learned to code on a borrowed laptop during the pandemic, and that experience shaped how I approach problems — with patience, not perfection. Since then, I have worked as an AI Research Associate at Skill Museum and Research Center, where I have helped build vision-language systems on low-cost hardware like Raspberry Pi and Jetson Nano. These were not polished demos. They were quiet attempts to make intelligence useful in places where resources are scarce.

I am now preparing to pursue a postgraduate degree. I do not have the means to support myself abroad, but I have the drive to learn, to contribute, and to keep building with what is available. 

I have attached my CV, Statement of Results, and Statement of Purpose. I am asking if there might be an opportunity to join your lab in a supportive role, one that allows me to learn from your team while contributing to your research, and helping me sustain my studies.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Respectfully,  
Bibek Poudel
