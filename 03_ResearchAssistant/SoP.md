| My fascination with artificial intelligence began not in a classroom, but in the quiet hum of a Raspberry Pi, watching a small robot navigate its environment using nothing but code I had written. That moment crystallized my ambition: to build intelligent systems that perceive, reason, and act autonomously in the real world. This passion has driven me through my undergraduate studies in Computing with Artificial Intelligence at London Metropolitan University and into hands-on research roles where I’ve developed edge-AI prototypes for autonomous navigation and assistive technologies. I am now eager to pursue a Master’s degree in Computer Science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill to deepen my theoretical foundation and contribute to cutting-edge research in deep learning, computer vision, and autonomous systems.                                                                                                                                                                                             | not in raspberry pi as well, i started machine learning from grade 11 during the COVID period, before that i was the student who hate the QBASIC,programming or anything  related to computers but during covid i don't why i chose machine learning maybe the term itself was suficient enough to fascinate a person. then after i joined bachelor i joined skill museum and research center i was first intern in that company with two of my supervisors or seniors and one very brillliant robotics guy, a technical guy. both two of my supervisors as well were sound in their respective area with deep experience. our parent company was a marketing company for different colleges, they said happening partner. and different tech related programmes it organize in its client colleges i used to build projects collaborating with my supervisors, the projects were basic intially referencing articles from google and experience of my supervisors, we developed robotics projects with arduino, raspberry pi, and internal mini-projects in Python, machine learning demonstrations and so on. i worked and side wise side that place provided me the opportunity to self-learn. i was studying  computing with artificial intelligence course at islington due to my prior experience and exposure with machine learning, then i started diving into deep learning started with computer vision concepts like classificiation, localization, segmentation. initially i started with tensorflow worked on projects like a assistive goggles which was  wearable robotic project which  detected objects(object detection algorithm was tflite model trained in custom dataset along with the text to speech functionality using pyttsx3 python library, raspberry pi 4 was used along with pi camera 2 allong with other electronic components.), a sign language detection model,finetuned yolov8 in custom dataset for sign language detection (7 different signs), then the assisitive goggle  was improvised by replacing the rapsberry pi with esp32 s3 webcam which was only used for streaming the visual information which was processed through a laptop where the model would run in real time and  pyttsx3 was used as previously for text to speech. then i worked on central quality inspection system where i worked on developing a software which allowed automated quality assurance of digital designs ranging from social medias,web sites, display standee, brochures, certificates and more creative documents, computer vision, regex, opencv were major utilities used in this project where the django was a web framework and react for frontend and overall system's appearance, then i also worked on another project named self driving car which was a prototypic model of medium size kid's  toy car (one person capacity) into a autonomous vehicle. we worked on different approaches from continuos steering control, classification model to robust dyanamic angle-based cruise control and robust segmentation with finetuned yolov11 segmentation model, we collected the dataset, labelled it and trained the model and deployed the whole system in a jetson orin nano along with traffic light detection and stop sign detection as additional feature of the autonomous vehicle. i get to work with development boards as powerful as jetson orin nano, it was fun working with such powerhouse in that form factor. we also worked on a research topic that we discovered while working in the self-driving car project. we found out that when we trained the segmentation model using our in-situ image augmentation framework during data collection we found some improvement of the model in terms of generalization and working effectively with very less false positive in different new conditions the model haven't trained explicitly on. we used specialized dslr camera for data collection and tweaking the brightness we captured the images using 3 different exposure levels and perform 3 experiments from classification model to segmenation model, we tested on currently sota yolov11-segmentation model and Masked R-CNN as well and found some evidence that brightness actually effect the accuracy,robustness and generalization ability of the model. but this work was put on hold due to some company's related issue which i am not aware or informed too much. stock price prediction was another project which I worked on where i actually worked with the stock's data of NEPSE (Nepal stock exchange) and explored the aspects of time-series forecasting. Apart from building project, involved in research and development, i also worked pretty well in my softskills as well. I have delivered many lecture sessions, tutorials, and workshops in the topics ranging from basic python programming to building computer vision models to many students and my juniors. Creating slides, delivering content, responding and addressing  the queries, guiding career paths are some of my notable contribution aside from project development. I have visited around Nepal from east to west showcasing the projects we developed, awaring and teaching students from different classes, different levels and ffrom different geographical regions on how the technology is shaping today's world, how actually the most used tools like AI tools chatgpt, claude works, how exactly the tesla's self driving car works ,and many more. Even though i haven't worked explicitly on the deployment aspect but i have some idea of working in the server, and dockerizing the project before hand, and making it  ready to run in the server.  this was all I did for 2.5 years from second semester to end of my Bachelor's. |
| My academic journey has equipped me with a robust technical toolkit. My coursework covered core areas including Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Robotics, Big Data, and Software Engineering, providing me with a solid understanding of both foundational theory and practical implementation. I have consistently sought to apply this knowledge beyond the syllabus. For instance, my project on “Autonomous Navigating Robot with Nvidia Jetson” involved implementing behavior cloning techniques and deploying models on the Jetson Orin Nano, giving me direct experience with real-time inference on embedded platforms—a crucial skill for developing scalable AI solutions. Similarly, my work on “Contextual Object Detection with YOLOv8 Llama 3.1-Vision” allowed me to explore the emerging frontier of vision-language models by fine-tuning state-of-the-art architectures like Llama 3.1-Vision using Unsloth and Hugging Face Transformers, integrating them with object detection pipelines for real-time contextual generation. | Academically, i don't say i was brilliant student or have exceptional results but i did fine enough working 8-10 hours and studying bachelor's away from my home. and the  results are also not that bad, i got first class honours classificiation from london metropolitan  university in computing with artificial intelligence 3-years course. academically, along with course's content my focus was generative AI and natural language process, llms really fascinated me along with the auto word suggestions from google keyboard. so i started learning NLP as well, learnt,explored and developed few projects unfolding how the text is converted into numbers without losing its meaning and context, how it can be quantify? i started with learning about sentencepiece, BPE, then ChatGPT broke out, late llama got released the open source model then i get into llama,  huggingface, pytorch, ollama, llama-cpp, finetuning llms, prompt engineering. the llama model from Meta was something that actually pulled me into the language processing and modelling paradigms. I learnt probability and statistics during my second year at college which  i found to be very useful and behind many nlp algorithms (like what?) and  the large language model themselves. I tested many other llms like, phi, granite, llama through  ollama. then i moved in to learning huggingface transformers, the paper attention is all you need really intrigued me so learnt the attention mechanism and whole transformer architecture in depth and implemented it as well using PyTorch. Even though i get started with Tensorflow later I shifted to PyTorch due the  ease of use, GPU and cuda support by PyTorch and overall learning curve i liked about PyTorch. with my rtx 3050 4gb vram, 16gb ram my laptop i tried many different llms, and diffusion models as well where for most of the time i encountered the resources bottleneck. while testing with the llms, learning different papers from deepseek, qwen i realized llms are powerful but they can made up things to easily and for the first look we won't be able to distinguish whether that actually makes sense or not. loading the models directly from huggingface transformer was creating the problem of resource bottleneck then i realized why the tools like ollama have been developed, later I also learnt and used the llama-cpp which was very smooth with my specs of computer but not quite reliable as ollama but i saw the prospect and what was actually trying to do by llama-cpp developers. my notable academic project i develped during my final year where first i tried to develop image captioning model from scratch where I learnt how the image and textual data are aligned in such fashion that the model can generate the caption for the image instead of bare classification only. this deepened my curiosity then i also tried to generate the caption to the images by trying to integrate the yolov11 for object detection and grounding and then llama model for caption generation. At that time i didn't realized that the image token must be passed and aligned to the llms in order for them to understand what is exactly happening i the image and it requires a lot of training this bottleneck allowed me to explore further and learnt about vision langauge models. Llava was first multi-modal model or VLM that i tested and introduced to. This intersection  of vision and language intrigued me very much and I want to further explore this field. So,I decided to work on similar project related to VLM as my final year project (30 credits). My final year project was named Contextual Object Detection. The final project used Moondream2 small vlm for image captioning and visual  question answering but throughout this project development timeline, i tested and researched on multiple different models, the underlying working mechanism, the amount of research this research area/space. I wanted to train my own vision language model as well but the resources constraints was there. Instead I started to build the theoretical knowledge as well which was also indeed very essential. I started reading papers (first paper from this paradigm  i read was an image worth 16x16 words) this paper introduced vision transformer to me then i gradually moved towards more advance topic like how the vision encoder tokenize/encodes the image patches and those patches are provided into the embedding space of llms through a multimodal connector or aligner which tokenized or algined the language token along with vision token to pass them to large language model component of vlm to generate the caption, answering visual queries from the image and so on. The problem i found with VLM was they hallucinated alot so i felt like just like human beings first grounds everything from the scene to explain or understand the scene, in same mannner the vlms also might requires something as grounding which later i found out is being implement in recent works like Molmo Open Vision language model developed by AI2 (Allen Institute of AI), and many other different paper. My interest and a deep hunger was there about the dataset development as well. I always felt what goes inside comes outside (garbage in garbage out), so carefully collected and curated dataset is what will make the models better and smarter instead of just increasing the parameters or adding the complexity to the architecture. so academically my interest was purely towards multi-modal learning and vision language models.                                                                                                                   |
| Beyond individual projects, I thrive in collaborative, research-driven environments. As an AI Research Associate at Skill Museum and Research Center (ING Group), I lead R&D efforts spanning computer vision and NLP, mentoring junior researchers and organizing workshops to foster innovation. This role has honed my ability to translate complex concepts into accessible demonstrations and to manage the full lifecycle of a project—from conceptualization and model development to deployment and documentation. My experience as a private tutor further strengthened my communication skills and reinforced my commitment to making technology accessible, a value I believe aligns with UNC-Chapel Hill’s mission.

| I graduated with First Class Honours from London Metropolitan University, a testament to my dedication and academic rigor. While my transcript reflects a few early challenges, my performance improved significantly in later years, particularly in advanced modules like Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, and Applied Machine Learning, where I earned top grades. I view these experiences not as setbacks, but as evidence of my resilience and capacity for growth—qualities I will bring to your program.

My journey into artificial intelligence began unexpectedly during the global lockdowns of 2020. As a high school student with little interest in programming—having once dreaded even basic QBASIC—I found myself captivated by the phrase “machine learning.” That curiosity led me to explore online tutorials, and soon, I was training my first models on a modest laptop. What started as fascination quickly evolved into a mission: to build intelligent systems that understand and interact meaningfully with the physical world. This drive has shaped my academic path, research work, and long-term aspirations—and it is why I am applying to the Master of Science program in Computer Science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

I am currently completing my BSc (Hons) in Computing with Artificial Intelligence at London Metropolitan University through Islington College in Kathmandu, Nepal, where I will graduate with First-Class Honours. My coursework—spanning Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Robotics, Big Data, and Software Engineering—has provided a strong theoretical foundation. But it is my hands-on research at the **Skill Museum and Research Center (ING Group)** that has truly defined my growth. As the first AI intern and now an AI Research Associate, I’ve led the development of edge-AI prototypes that bridge theory and real-world impact.

One of my earliest projects was **Assisted Vision Goggles for the Visually Impaired**, a wearable system that detects everyday objects and reads Nepali currency using a custom-trained TensorFlow Lite model on a Raspberry Pi 4, with voice feedback via pyttsx3. Later, I upgraded the system by replacing the Pi with an ESP32-CAM for lightweight video streaming, offloading inference to a laptop—a practical lesson in balancing computational constraints and user needs. This project taught me the importance of accessibility in AI and sparked my interest in embedded vision systems.

My passion for autonomy led me to develop a **prototype self-driving vehicle** using a modified toy car. We explored multiple approaches—from classification-based steering to dynamic angle control—before settling on a robust pipeline using a fine-tuned YOLOv11 segmentation model trained on in-house data collected under varying lighting conditions. Notably, during data collection, we experimented with multi-exposure imaging and observed that controlled brightness variation improved model generalization and reduced false positives in unseen environments. Though this line of inquiry was paused due to organizational constraints, it revealed to me how subtle data curation choices can profoundly influence model robustness—a question I hope to explore rigorously in graduate research.

Beyond robotics, I have delved into **generative AI and vision-language models**. In one project, I integrated **YOLOv8 with Llama 3.1-Vision** to generate contextual descriptions of detected objects in real time, using Unsloth for efficient fine-tuning and Hugging Face Transformers for deployment. I also explored time-series forecasting through a **stock price prediction system** for the Nepal Stock Exchange (NEPSE), comparing classical decision trees with transformer-based architectures and incorporating technical indicators like MACD.

These experiences have solidified my research interests at the intersection of **computer vision, deep learning, and embedded systems**, with a focus on **autonomous perception** and **efficient model deployment**. I am particularly drawn to UNC-Chapel Hill’s M.S. program for its structured yet flexible curriculum, especially the **breadth requirement** that encourages exploration across Theory, Systems, and Applications. Courses such as **COMP 664 (Deep Learning)**, **COMP 755 (Machine Learning)**, **COMP 776 (Computer Vision in our 3D World)**, and **COMP 734 (Distributed Systems)** align perfectly with my goals. I am also eager to engage with faculty working on **robotics perception**, **multimodal learning**, or **edge AI optimization**—areas critical to building safe, scalable autonomous technologies.

While I may not have been a “brilliant” student from the start, my academic record reflects steady growth, resilience, and deep engagement with advanced topics. My final-year performance in AI, Computer Vision, and NLP earned top marks, and my independent projects demonstrate initiative beyond the classroom. I’ve also mentored peers through workshops and hackathons, believing that knowledge grows when shared—a value I see reflected in UNC’s collaborative culture.

Long-term, I aim to contribute to the next generation of **reliable, real-time autonomous systems**—whether in self-driving vehicles, assistive robotics, or intelligent edge devices. The M.S. program at UNC-Chapel Hill offers the ideal environment to develop the theoretical depth, research discipline, and technical rigor needed to turn this vision into reality.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to learn from, and contribute to, the vibrant research community at UNC-Chapel Hill.

I never imagined I’d fall in love with computers. In high school, I dreaded even basic QBASIC assignments. But during the quiet isolation of the 2020 pandemic, something shifted. The phrase “machine learning” caught my attention—not because I understood it, but because it sounded like magic. That curiosity led me down a rabbit hole of online tutorials, and soon, I was training my first models on a modest laptop. What began as fascination has since grown into a deep commitment: to build intelligent systems that see, understand, and act in the real world. Today, as a First-Class Honours graduate in Computing with Artificial Intelligence from London Metropolitan University (via Islington College, Nepal), I am eager to join UNC-Chapel Hill’s M.S. program to transform my hands-on experience into rigorous research—particularly in **multimodal learning**, **computer vision**, and **efficient AI for edge systems**.

My undergraduate journey was anything but conventional. Far from being a “brilliant” student from the start, I worked 8–10 hours daily, often away from home, to master concepts that once felt alien. Yet this struggle cultivated resilience—and a hunger to learn beyond the syllabus. While my coursework covered core areas like Computer Vision, NLP, Robotics, and Big Data, my real education happened in the lab. As the first AI intern—and later an AI Research Associate—at the **Skill Museum and Research Center (ING Group)**, I collaborated with experienced mentors and a brilliant robotics engineer to build prototypes that bridged theory and impact.

Early on, I developed **Assisted Vision Goggles** for the visually impaired: a wearable system using a custom TensorFlow Lite model to detect objects and read Nepali currency, with voice feedback via `pyttsx3` on a Raspberry Pi 4. Later, I replaced the Pi with an ESP32-S3 CAM for lightweight video streaming, offloading inference to a laptop—a practical lesson in balancing latency, accuracy, and hardware constraints. I also built a **sign language recognition system** using fine-tuned YOLOv8 on a custom dataset of seven Nepali signs, and contributed to a **Central Quality Inspection System** that automated design validation for digital media using OpenCV, regex, Django, and React.

But my deepest passion emerged through our **autonomous vehicle project**—a medium-sized toy car retrofitted into a self-driving prototype. We iterated from classification-based steering to dynamic angle control, ultimately deploying a fine-tuned YOLOv11 segmentation model on a **Jetson Orin Nano**, complete with traffic light and stop sign detection. During data collection, we noticed something unexpected: when we captured images at multiple exposure levels using a DSLR and trained models with this brightness-varied data, performance improved significantly in unseen lighting conditions—suggesting that controlled illumination diversity enhances generalization and reduces false positives. Though this line of inquiry was paused due to organizational constraints, it sparked my interest in **data-centric AI** and the role of **input distribution design** in model robustness.

Parallel to robotics, I dove into **generative AI and language modeling**. Captivated by Google’s keyboard suggestions and later by ChatGPT and Meta’s open-source **Llama** models, I explored how text becomes meaning. I studied tokenization (BPE, SentencePiece), implemented the Transformer architecture from scratch in PyTorch, and experimented with fine-tuning LLMs using Hugging Face, Unsloth, and `llama.cpp`. My limited hardware (RTX 3050, 16GB RAM) taught me the realities of resource bottlenecks—fueling my interest in **efficient inference** and **model compression**.

This led me to **vision-language models (VLMs)**. My final-year project, **“Contextual Object Detection,”** integrated object grounding with caption generation using models like Moondream2 and LLaVA. Through this, I realized that VLMs often **hallucinate**—and that robust perception may require explicit **visual grounding**, much like humans anchor understanding in observed entities. I read foundational papers like _“An Image is Worth 16x16 Words”_ and studied how vision encoders tokenize patches, align them with language embeddings, and feed them into LLMs. I became convinced: the future of autonomous systems lies not in vision _or_ language alone, but in their **tight, grounded integration**.

UNC-Chapel Hill’s M.S. program is the ideal place to pursue this vision. The **breadth requirement** across Theory, Systems, and Applications will help me build a holistic foundation, while courses like **COMP 664 (Deep Learning)**, **COMP 755 (Machine Learning)**, **COMP 776 (Computer Vision in our 3D World)**, and **COMP 734 (Distributed Systems)** align precisely with my goals. I’m especially eager to engage with faculty researching **multimodal learning**, **robotics perception**, or **edge-AI optimization**—areas critical to building safe, real-time autonomous agents.

Beyond technical work, I’ve mentored dozens of students through workshops and tech festivals across Nepal, explaining everything from Python basics to how Tesla’s Autopilot works. These experiences reinforced my belief that technology must be **accessible, explainable, and human-centered**—values I see reflected in UNC’s collaborative ethos.

Long-term, I aim to become a researcher who bridges the gap between cutting-edge AI and real-world deployment—whether in self-driving systems, assistive robotics, or efficient multimodal agents. With its strong research culture, interdisciplinary opportunities, and emphasis on both depth and breadth, UNC-Chapel Hill offers the perfect environment to grow as a scholar and innovator.

Thank you for considering my application. I am ready to contribute my passion, perseverance, and hands-on experience to your program—and to learn from the best minds in computer science.
