Dear professor x/y, 

I hope this email find you well. I am writing this email regarding my interest in pursuing Masters research under your supervision in the sector of generative AI and multimodal learning. 

I am an undergraduate student from Nepal with strong background in mathematics, programming, generative AI and computer vision. My experiences and research interest align closely with the work being done at your lab X. I would be deeply grateful for the opportunity to have you as my prospective advisor. 

My Notable Projects and Works.
1. [Contextual Object Detection](https://github.com/graahand/contextual-object-detection/tree/integrated)
2. [Self Driving Robot](https://github.com/Skill-Museum/Self-Driving-Car)
3. [Skin Health Analysis](https://github.com/Skill-Museum/derma-scan-backend)
4. [Emotion Detection](https://github.com/Skill-Museum/emotion-detection)
5. [Object Detection with Text-to-Speech](https://github.com/graahand/Object-Detection-with-YOLO-with-Text-to-Speech/blob/master/Code/object_detection_with_tts.py)

I am eager to further develop my research capabilities and contribute meaningfully to cutting-edge work in generative and multimodal systems. I would be truly grateful for the opportunity to discuss potential openings in your lab or any advice you might offer regarding the application process.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration. I have attached my CV for your reference and would be happy to provide any additional materials upon request.

Warm regards,

**Subject:** Prospective Master’s Researcher — Aligning Generative AI, Multimodal Learning & Human-Centered Vision with RAIVN Lab

Dear Professor Krishna,

I hope this message finds you well.

My name is **Bibek Poudel**, an undergraduate researcher from Nepal currently pursuing my BSc in Computing with Artificial Intelligence (London Metropolitan University / Islington College). I am writing to express my strong interest in joining your lab — the **RAIVN Lab at UW** — as a Master’s research student, with the aspiration of contributing to your pioneering work at the intersection of **computer vision, multimodal learning, and human-AI interaction**.

Your research philosophy — _“teaching machines to see like people and interact with people”_ — deeply resonates with my own trajectory. I’ve been captivated by your recent work, especially **Molmo** (CVPR 2025 Oral), **Visual Program Distillation** (CVPR 2024 Oral), and **Selective Visual Representations** (ICLR 2024 Spotlight), which elegantly bridge model reasoning, human interpretability, and embodied interaction. The way your lab leverages behavioral and social science frameworks to bootstrap machine learning — as seen in papers like _“Explanations can Reduce Overreliance on AI Systems”_ (CSCW 2023) — is exactly the kind of human-centered, interdisciplinary AI I am passionate about advancing.

As an **AI Research Associate at Skill Museum & Research Center**, I’ve led R&D on edge-AI prototypes that mirror your lab’s ethos:  
→ **Contextual Object Detection with YOLOv8 + Llama 3.1-Vision** — integrating vision-language models for real-time scene understanding (fine-tuned with Unsloth/Colab).  
→ **Assisted Vision Goggles for the Visually Impaired** — deploying object/currency detection on Raspberry Pi/ESP32-CAM with Nepali TTS feedback, emphasizing accessibility and human interaction.  
→ **Autonomous Navigating Robot with Jetson Orin Nano** — implementing behavior cloning for lane-following, directly touching on embodied AI and navigation (tools: ROS concepts, OpenCV, CUDA).  
→ **Stock Prediction using Transformer Architectures** — exploring temporal reasoning and decision-making under uncertainty.

I’ve also written technical blogs on Medium since 2022, translating complex DL/CV concepts for broader audiences — a practice I know you value, given your commitment to public scholarship (e.g., PBS NOVA, Science, Forbes features).

What excites me most about your lab is how you tackle _compositionality_, _faithfulness_, and _human grounding_ in vision-language systems — challenges I’ve grappled with in my own projects. I’m particularly eager to contribute to efforts like **Synthetic Visual Genome**, **Visual Sketchpad**, or **AHA: Detecting Failures in Robotic Manipulation**, where synthetic data, human feedback, and model introspection converge.

I am confident that my hands-on experience with **PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, CUDA, Jetson/RPi deployment**, and **multimodal prototyping** — combined with my drive to build AI that _understands and serves people_ — would allow me to meaningfully contribute to your team.

I’ve attached my CV for your review. I would be deeply honored to discuss potential opportunities to join your lab, even informally, or to receive any guidance you might offer for strengthening my application to UW CSE.

Thank you so much for your time and inspiration. I look forward to the possibility of learning from and contributing to your groundbreaking work.

Warm regards,

Subject: Possible PhD opportunity

Dear Dr…..

I am Sandhya Sharma, a conservationist, and reigning Miss Nepal International 2020. I have completed my Master's in Forestry from Forest Research University, India. I have secured an A+ in my Master's thesis where I worked on "Modelling of fire hotspots under future climatic scenarios in Nepal". I am also ranked among the top students of my class, based on the scale of cumulative grade point average.

I have gone through your research papers and I'm delighted to learn about your extensive research in the field of forestry, which is very knowledgeable and inspiring. In my bachelor's thesis, I worked on the comparison of carbon stock in Chure, Bhabar and Terai and was also awarded a grant for the same. I am personally interested in forest management approaches and application of remote sensing and gis in the field of forestry, and I believe our research interests have a number of similarities. There is a lot I can learn from you, and so I wish to join a doctoral program at the —---------------under your supervision.

I have attached my CV and marksheet with this email but if there is any additional information that I have not included that you would like, I would be happy to provide it to you. I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely
