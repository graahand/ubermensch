# the craft of writing effectively (larry mcEnerney)

1. Unlike students who learn writing as a separate skill from thinking, experts use writing to develop their thinking itself.

2. take articles in your field and circle down, list down  the words that is creating values to the readers. 
3. every community have their codes which makes the writing valueable to users,sets of words that communicates values. 
4. Many writers mistakenly assume their readers will care about their work simply because it is academic or drafted. In reality, readers are motivated only if the writing is valuable and relevant to their own needs or interests. Value, therefore, lies in the eyes of the reader, not just in clarity, organization, or persuasion.

5. The challenge lies in the disconnect between how expert writers write (to think) and how expert readers read (to understand and make sense). Writers use language patterns that support their thinking but may confuse or slow down readers.
