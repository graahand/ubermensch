| RT-1              | It uses a Transformer network that takes as input visual data (images from a robot camera) and a natural language instruction describing the task. It converts these inputs, along with the robot's action space, into tokens.                                                                                                              |
| Open-X-Embodiment | The **Open X-Embodiment** is a major initiative and a corresponding **large-scale, open-source dataset** for robotic learning.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Voxposer          | **VoxPoser** is an architecture that builds directly on the "Code-as-Policies" idea, focusing on grounding language instructions into **3D space** for motion planning.It uses the code-writing capabilities of an LLM to orchestrate the generation of **Composable 3D Value Maps** (or cost maps).                                        |
| Scaling-up        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Code-as-Policies  | Instead of generating a single action or a sequence of high-level steps, the LLM writes an executable program (a _Language Model Program_ or LMP). This program can contain logic like `if/then` statements and `for` loops, and it calls specific robot APIs (e.g., `move_to_object()`, `grasp()`). (what apis might be there like these?) |
