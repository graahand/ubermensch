a lab working on vision language model from university of michigan. their most famous and influential paper is about grounding the llm or vlm. (connecting language units to their referents in the phyical world is grounding)  

grounding open vocabulary acquisition (GOVA) is a process josma next word predict garne vanda ni words haru ko real world meaning lai visual information ko through associate garxa. like manxe le physical interaction batw language sikne garxa.

vision language models haru ma GOVA le model train garda next word predict sang sangai use vako words haru lai visually physical world ma image ko through ground garxa or justify garxa. 

sled lab le afno world-to-words:grounded open vocabulary acquisition vanne paper ACL 2023 ma publish gareko thiyo rw yo paper ma mention vako model chai [OctoBERT](https://huggingface.co/sled-umich/OctoBERT) ho.

yo sled lab ko professor chai joyce y chai ho, uslai contact garne ki?
