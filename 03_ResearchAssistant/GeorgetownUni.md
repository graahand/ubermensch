## Infosense Lab 

[Grace Hui Yang](https://infosense.cs.georgetown.edu/grace)

she is also looking for PhD student in **information retrieval, deep reinforcement learning, interactive agents and privacy-preserving IR**. 

she is looking for a candidate with strong **maths skills (calculus, probs, linear algebra [islington]), programming skills in Python (PyTorch [done]), writing skills (for research publication [SMaRC])**


her notable works are listed in this link: [Grace Hui Yang Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nafo_HAAAAAJ)



I found the most useful paper for my usecase as well (EchoRobot) where she published her work on **conversational agents that understand** the user's need and interacts naturally and effectively. 


She also pioneered the **question answering method for multimedia content(news, videos, text)**

*effective searching and sorting, search engines and search mechanisms, reinforcement learning for information retrieval, anonymization techniques for privacy IR*
