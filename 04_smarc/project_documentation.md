1. existing documentation which must contain the information as (what is the project about? what did you used, tech stack/methodology? problems you encountered (requirement changes or feature feasibility, time/resource constraints? how those problems/challenges were solved or mitigated (debugging, key notes and considerations), future works and your reflection on the project), check the quality of the documentation (blunders, correctness and any AI assistant that might have altered the documentation essence.) before sharing it to Pawan Dai. Include every resources (files/folders/notes). 
2. code base that haven't been pushed to our SMaRC GitHub)
