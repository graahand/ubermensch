application of ai in cybersecurity is categorized into prediction, prevention, detection, response and monitoring. 
and AI applications are divided by technical layers:
network (network traffic analysis and intrusion detection): deepexploit and open-appsec, snort IDS,panther
endpoint (anti-malware) openVAS, SEMA,Malware Environment for Openai gym,Ossec
application (WAF or database firewalls): 
User (UBA)
Process Behaviour (anti-fraud)

1. A3C (Asynchronous advantage actor critic)
2. Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) top 10 list is the list of the ten most critical security risks to web application and API.  yo list ma sql injection, cross-site scripting (xss) ani data exposure rw security misconfigurations haru parxa. 
3. zero day attack vaneko chai vendor haru lai pani idea navako exist garxa yo vulnerability vanne testo attack chai zero day attacks ho. 
4. SEMA (Symbolic Execution for Malware Analysis)
5. OpenVAS, it scans vulnerability from ip address, host names and network ranges and it provides the device and running software information like operating system, installed applications and running services, it also send non-destructive benign payloads to the system to check the vulnerability, these payloads are carefully crafted.

projects: 
1. dns traffic monitoring tool, yesko lagi chai proxy ma aaune logs haru sabai collect garnu paryo ani  tesma chai ML implement garerw model train garnu paryo.
