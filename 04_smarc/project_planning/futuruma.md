# Futuruma AI projects planning and tracking

1. sdc (traffic  light and stop sign detection, maybe through library approach it is possible, last time faced issue with stop sign detection)
instead of detection, perform segmentation for both stop sign and traffic light but with same model or different model,  i am confused??

2. avg  (training maybe new model, data collection from same camera source, discard esp32 if possible)
3. ai-math: quiz generation with very light weight model (question generation, database development, system prompt creation, production integration)
4. seat occupany: hardware and software both remaining
5. emotion: ready
6. stock price forecasting: ready but classification-based approach is possible




## sdc
self-driving-car project needs a implementation of stop sign detection and traffic light detection, last time we tried to work on these two features, it miserably failed even though the trained model was robust and the metrics suggested towards efficient real-world performance. Futuruma 2025, traffic light detection and stop sign detection, YOLOv11 based segmentation.
