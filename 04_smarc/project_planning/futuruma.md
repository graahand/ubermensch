# Futuruma AI projects planning and tracking

1. sdc (traffic  light and stop sign detection, maybe through library approach it is possible, last time faced issue with stop sign detection)
instead of detection, perform segmentation for both stop sign and traffic light but with same model or different model,  i am confused??

2. avg  (training maybe new model, data collection from same camera source, discard esp32 if possible)
3. ai-math: quiz generation with very light weight model (question generation, database development, system prompt creation, production integration)
4. seat occupany: hardware and software both remaining
5. emotion: ready
6. stock price forecasting: ready but classification-based approach is possible
<<<<<<< HEAD




## sdc
self-driving-car project needs a implementation of stop sign detection and traffic light detection, last time we tried to work on these two features, it miserably failed even though the trained model was robust and the metrics suggested towards efficient real-world performance. Futuruma 2025, traffic light detection and stop sign detection, YOLOv11 based segmentation.

### 30th century car race

yolo11n.pt  model will detects the objects, count the detected objects and show it in a small pyqt/tkinter based window.

assisted vision goggles: done
emotion detection: done

## rt-detr
real-time detection transformer
:Efficient hybrid encoder for multi-scale feature processing, uncertainty-minimal query selection, nms-free, end-to-end  transformer 
_NMS filters out redundant bounding boxes so only the most confident detection for each object remains._




AI PROJECT

1. SELF DRIVING CAR: This project includes existing features including lane detection (segmentation), dynamic steering control and obstacle detection. Added features includes traffic light detection and stop sign detection along with one command start. 
2. ASSISTED VISION GOGGLES: This projects includes Nepalese Currency Detection and Commonly found objects detection 2 different computer vision model. Added features includes human like text-to-speech for announcing detected objects and currency, smart switching between the object detection mode and cash detection mode. 
3. AI-MATH ASSISTANT: This project includes maths questions answering feature using Gemini API along with different modalities of input (image, text, gestures). Added AI features includes automatic quiz generation for different maths topics along with explanation provided for the wrong answered quizzes and additional related quizzes.
4. Emotion detection: This is new AI project with the core features including emotion, age group and gender detection, dashboard for detected emotions along with the face landmark/avatar generation/detection.
5. Stock Price Forecasting: This project implements the expanded datasets with the indicators values for each day stock price (indicators includes RSI and MACD). It predicts the next 7 days stocks prices prediction for 10 different development and commercial banks of Nepal when provided the last 30 days price history as input. It provides the forecasting charts and the closing prices. 
6. AI SAFARI: This project includes the existing features including animation of 17 different animals with interactive and appealing background scene. Added feature includes the addition of Bus as another element for animation and new background (optional).
7. 30th Century Car: This project implements the AI-based object detection along with the dashboard for number of objects during the racing.
