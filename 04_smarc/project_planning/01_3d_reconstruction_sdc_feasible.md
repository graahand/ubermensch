# Feasibilty Study and Prototyping with 3d reconstruction from 2d images. 

self driving car lacks a advance real world navigation and localization mechanism which is often required for advancing with the development of autonomous vehicles which have the applications areas such as industry robots at coca-cola factory, rod haru weilding garne thauma, aru applications areas, an



with no other resources other than the existing ones, we will perform fast prototyping with 3d reconstruction with 2d images for real world navigation, our resources are enough for such ability for to produce such results according to the study done on this topic. currently our self driving perform segmentation at fixed path with the help of YOLOv11-segmentation model finetuned to deal with the problem of direct sunglight and model le nadekheko naya or odd kura jun real world ma huna sakxa with a real-world dynamic steering control mechanism (we only train for segmentation,we don't actually train the model with steering angle provided as labels) strength {strength maybe}.



## 3d reconstruction

**[link to article](https://medium.com/@popovici.cristina211/3d-reconstruction-from-2d-images-using-openmvg-and-openmvs-b23bc7adb616)**


it involves combination of  two things. 

openMVG and openMVS.

mvs means multiple view geometry, which means creating 3d maps with [triangulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangulation)(producing 3d points based on a special point (base point) from the image (every image contains that))  

mvs means multi view stereo,which further means you get the 3d points from mvs now create a scene for those points connecting the dots (dense point cloud) and this can be rendered in 3d.  

[NeRF, neural radiance field](https://huggingface.co/learn/computer-vision-course/unit8/nerf) is a alternative to openmvs and openmvg but it is  evolving and active field of research. 
nerf means storing 3d scene within neural networks. a faster training and inference effort by nvidia [instant-ngp](https://nvlabs.github.io/instant-ngp/) in 2022.

### process 

    Image collection
    Feature extraction
    Feature matching
    Structure from Motion (SfM)
    Dense point-cloud reconstruction
    Mesh Reconstruction
    Mesh Refinement
    Mesh Texturing


you collect twohigh quality images that overlap (matching garna ko lagi) with exif metadata (3d points calculate garna ko lagi (like focal length)). feature extraction is done with the help me algorithms like SIFT, AKAZE, SURF. then comes feature mapping 
feature mapping is the next step where similar points between different pictures are matched to see how they relate to each other. 

then the skeleton (sparse point cloud) for the 3d construction is created through [structure from motion]. by extracting the camera position and orientation (camera pose) for each image, it provides the information about where the vehicle was and how it was facing wehn the image was captured. based on that the rays(lines) are created for construction initial skeleton
    (bundle adjustment is done to refine the 3d points and avoid any errors.)

[3d_reconstruction_sdc_feasibles](#depth-estimation-and-ed-reconstruction) sfm only creates a sparse point cloud which is further refined with dense point-cloud reconstruction step. depthmaps (each pixel in image tells how far away that part of scene is) are created in this step using machine learning algorithms or stereo vision (two camera capturing same thing like two eyes, those two images are essential for estimating depth and {disparity}). yo step ma depthmaps and sfm le deko sparse 3d points combine garerw dense cloud point banainxa.

now mesh construction is done with algorithms like *(delaunay tetrahedralization and poisson surface reconstruction), mesh is refined with techniques like *(edge collapse, vertex split, and mesh simplification) and final step is mesh texturing (photogrammetry, lambertian surfaces {surface that reflects light evenly in all direction (matte surface)}, but shiny (Non-lambertian surfaces might cause problems for mesh consturction and texturing process.))

**“Most autonomous vehicles use powerful AI programs called vision transformers to take 2D images from multiple cameras and create a representation of the 3D space around the vehicle,” said Tianfu Wu (associate professor of North carolina state university)**

*they actually proposes the technique called Multi-view Atttentive Contextualization (MvACon) which allow vision transformers to better utilize the data from 2d images for creating 3d maps.*


**We developed a method to automatically transform video recordings into 3D virtual environments, using Gaussian splatting to create solids and textures.**, says [deepsense-ai](https://deepsense.ai/case-studies/automating-3d-map-rendering-for-autonomous-vehicle-testing/)



### depth estimation and ed reconstruction
[meta vggt-1b model for 3d reconstruction comes with depth estimation model as well,these can also be experimented and used]
