2. Leonardo da vinci le robotics ma pani contribution diyeko xan, jesma usle human anatomy and kinematics lai ramro sanga research garerw, tyo kura haru lai chai automation, robotics ma implement gareko painxa, josko example Leanardo's Fiat vanne automated(self-propelled) cart xa. yesko fully working replica 2006 ma Florence vanne thauma banaiyeko xah.

3. Vaucanson's Digesting Automated Duck (replicates the actual duck)
4. simulation rw automation ko difference k ho vanda, simulation ma chai just yo kura chalxa kina chalxa thahaxaina, just chalxa. But automation ma chai aim k hunxa vanda robot chalxa vane kasari chalxa? mechanics pani explain garne aim hunxa.
