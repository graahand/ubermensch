# Overview

This lesson teaches how to use a **flowchart** to show the steps a robot takes and the choices it makes. Students will learn the main flowchart symbols, draw a flowchart for a navigate-and-stop task, trace the path through yes / no decisions, and check charts for missing or repeating steps. They will work in teams and present their charts clearly.

# Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will recognise flowchart symbols, explain how a flowchart shows robot steps and choices, draw and trace a simple flowchart, spot and fix errors, and present their work clearly in teams.

- Recognise **start / stop**, **process**, **decision**, and **arrow** symbols in a flowchart.
    
- Explain how a flowchart shows the steps and choices a robot makes.
    
- Draw a flowchart for a simple navigate-and-stop task.
    
- Trace a flow through yes / no decisions correctly.
    
- Find missing or looping steps and repair the chart.
    
- Compare two charts and choose the clearer one.
    
- Present their chart and accept improvement ideas while keeping diagrams legible.
    
# Introduction

Imagine a delivery robot moving through Thamel to reach a shop. The robot needs clear steps: start, move forward, check for obstacles, and stop at the shop. How do we show these steps so a robot maker or friend can follow them easily? A **flowchart** is a picture that shows the order of steps and decisions.

**Think:** If the robot finds a puddle in front of it on a rainy day in Pokhara, how will the chart tell the robot what to do next?
# Concepts Explanation

## Key Terms

- **Flowchart**: a diagram that shows the order of steps and choices in a task.
    
- **Start / stop**: marks the beginning and end of the process.
    
- **Process**: an action the robot does (for example, **move forward**, **pick up**).
    
- **Decision**: a yes / no question that changes the path (for example, **Is there an obstacle?**).
    
- **Arrow**: a line with an arrowhead that shows the direction of the steps.
    
- **Trace**: follow the arrows from start to finish to see what happens.
    
## Word Alerts

- **Legible**: easy to read. Students should make their charts neat so others can follow them.
    
- **Loop**: a path that repeats steps. Loops can be useful but can also cause a robot to get stuck if not planned well.

## Flowchart Symbols 
| symbol           | name         | meaning                                   |
| ---------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Start / stop** | start / stop | Begin or end the flow.                    |
| **Process**      | process      | An action such as _move forward_.         |
| **Decision**     | decision     | A yes / no question that splits the flow. |
| **Arrow**        | arrow        | Shows the order and direction.            |
### Example 1 — Simple Navigate-and-Stop Flowchart 

Below is a small flowchart to move forward and stop if there is an obstacle.

# Activities and Problem Solving

## Activity One — Draw a Flowchart for Navigate-and-Stop

- Draw a classroom map from **Islington College** to the school gate. Mark two obstacles.
    
- In pairs (for example, Dolma and Yonten), draw a flowchart that tells a robot to: start, move forward, check for obstacle, if yes then turn right, if no then move forward, and finally stop at the gate.
    
- Test the chart by moving a toy robot on the map and tracing the arrows.
## Quick Quiz 

1. (Multiple choice) Which symbol shows a yes / no question?  
    A. Process box  
    B. Decision diamond **(correct)**  
    C. Arrow
    
2. (Multiple choice) Which symbol marks the beginning of a flowchart?  
    A. ▭ Process  
    B. ◇ Decision  
    C. ⭘ Start **(correct)**
3. (Short answer) Write one process step you would use in a robot navigate task.  
	**Expected answers:** move forward; turn right; stop.
	
4. (True / false) A loop in a flowchart can cause a robot to repeat steps forever. **True**
