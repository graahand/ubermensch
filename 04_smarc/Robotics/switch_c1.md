### Prompt

Use this prompt to write content to match the curriculum, improve flow, simplify 
language, and enhance engagement.
 (You will need to upload the pdf of the curriculum/syallabus)
Hi, I’m writing a textbook that will also be an eBook for Grade __ Science. I’ve uploaded:
• The full curriculum PDF (for cross-reference)
• The curriculum for the specific unit I’m currently working on (learning outcomes and 5E lesson plan)
* and the sample file which have been through rigorous qc, its about the algorithm chapter of class 4, the way content is written, the depth, the alignment, the flow, the smoothness. you will need it as well. 
What I want you to do:
I'm going to share some content from this unit that I want to improve and align with the 
curriculum. Please:
• Improve explanations, examples, and context based on the curriculum's 
learning objectives and subject matter
• Use simple, clear language suitable for Grade __ students (aim for a
readability score above ___)
• Ensure curriculum alignment and flag any parts that go beyond it (so I can 
move them to a separate “Note” section). If the content all align to the curriculum, 
the no need to flag anything.
• Follow the Context–Content–Example pedagogy (start with a relatable context, 
then explain, then give examples)
• Add transitions so the content flows logically
• Use British spelling unless a term is fixed in another form
• Be creative: Use a variety of formats (tables, diagrams, bullet points) where it 
makes learning more engaging

FLOW FOR THE CONTENT GENERATION:
1. TABLE OF CONTENT: MAJOR TOPICS TO BE COVERED
2. LEARNING OBJECTIVES: 5-7
3. CHAPTER INTRODUCTION: try to include thought provoking content, like real life application of the topic about to be discussed or pose a question in the learner's mind.
4. CONCEPT EXPLANATION: word alerts and key terms (word alerts for contextual terms, key terms for technical words)
5. EXAMPLES:nepali examples as much as possible, nepali places (kathmandu, pokhara, butwal, biratnagar, village names from nepal from different provinces) ing companies(vairav technology, innovate tech, islington college, herald college kathmandu, itahari international college, biratnagar internationa college, kavya school, skill museum and research center, ing foods) to be used where technology or food or education comes. unless the example must be a specific non-nepali example, use nepali example. 
	also use the names that reflects the ethnicity of nepal like dolma, yonten, sujan, nisha, bibek, niraj  and many more. 
	for currency examples strictly use rupees instead of dollar or anything else.
6. SUMMARY
7. QUIZ OR EVALUATION FOR ACCORDING  TO THE 5E LESSON PLAN 



Notes: 
FLESCH READABILITY SCORE OF 75-85
ADDITIONAL INTRUCTIONS: titles should be sentence case i.e. 
	Advantages of Smartphones (x)
	Advantages of smartphones (works)
	use colon, spell out the numbers from 1-10 and use number for numbers after 10. 
	highlight important words or phrases.
YOU DON'T EXPLICITLY WRITE DOWN THE PHASES OF 5E RATHER MAKE THE FLOW SMOOTH FOR THE CONTENT SUCH THAT ALL THE 5E ARE INCLUDED THROUGH OUT THE CONTENT.

HOW LESSON CONTENT SHOULD BE ORGANIZED OR WRITTEN, REFERENCES EXTRACTED FROM THE SAMPLE CONTENT:
1. First part, overview of the lesson (no 5e model implemented here so don't)
2. second part, learning objectives (no 5e here as well so don't)
3. third part, introduction/concepts expansion or related concepts (5e implemented here, [ice-breaking, sparking curiosity, essense of the concept, then define, explain with example (engage, explore, explain)])
4. fourth part, creating different problem scenaris and allow studnets to use what they learnt through out the chapter for solving that problem..
5. fifth part, summarize what they learnt until now in 4 different E's and then a quiz or evaluation part of 5e.

5E CRITERIAS FOR EACH PHASE OF 5E:
1. ENGAGE: spark curiosity, reveal misconceptions, activate prior knowledge
2. EXPLORE: minimal instructions, hands-on activities,  collaborate and compare ideas, generate observations, multiple outcomes.
3. EXPLAIN: student's explanation, clarify their misconceptions, introduce new terms, connections to explore phase. 
4. ELABORATE: pply the understanding in new context, Real-world context & challenge, Encourage creativity, critical thinking or problem solving.
5. EVALUATE: Suitable Assessments Methods that can be measured (compare
	prior and current understanding)

AFTER THIS PROVIDE LEARNING OUTCOMES AND 5E LESSON PLAN TO THE MODEL FOR CONTENT GENERATION. 

sample:
LESSON 21: Switch
Cognitive
a. Explain that a switch controls the flow of electricity by
opening/closing circuits.
b. Identify types of switches (push, toggle, slide)
Technical a. Wire a switch into a circuit to control an LED or motor.
Problem-Solving Skills a. Predict the effect of placing a switch in different positions within a
circuit.
Soft Skills a. Learn discipline by turning off circuits when not in use

**LESSON PLAN**

**Engage**  
Students use coin battery, LED, magnet and a reed switch to create a simple circuit. The reed switch is activated by a magnet to turn the circuit on and off, helping students understand how switches control electricity.

**Explore**  
Students experiment with a basic switch to open and close circuits, observing how it controls the flow of electricity to turn the LED (like lights) on or off.

**Explain**  
(a) What is switch?  
(b) Types of switches.  
(c) How to incorporate switch in basic circuit to control the LED.

**Elaborate**  
Students build a circuit with real switches and LEDs to control the LED’s operation (on/off). They experiment with toggle, push-button, and slide switches to observe how each switch type affects the circuit and explore the usage of different switches in different conditions.

**Evaluate**  
Students will take a quiz (true/false, fill-in-the-blank, multiple-choice) on switches.

| Have you ever switched on the lights in your classroom or at home? With just one click, the room becomes bright. Have you wondered how such a small action can control electricity?<br><br>A switch works like a gate for electricity. When the gate is open, electricity cannot pass, and the light stays off. When the gate is closed, electricity flows, and the light turns on.<br><br>Let’s explore how switches work, the different types we use in daily life, and how we can use them in circuits for our robots. | anything other than light, like fan, a toy car, more relatable. switch is off when gate is open and switch on when gate is close isn't relatable at all rather confusing. |     |

| 1. Dolma switches on the ceiling fan at her home in Pokhara. The toggle switch closes the circuit, and the fan starts spinning.<br>2. Sujan connects a push switch to his circuit with a coin battery and LED. When he presses the switch, the LED glows. When he lets go, it turns off.<br>3. Yonten brings a reed switch to class. By moving a small magnet near it, the LED glows without touching the switch! This shows how some switches work without direct pressing. | instead of reed switch, its better to add the example for slide switch |     |
