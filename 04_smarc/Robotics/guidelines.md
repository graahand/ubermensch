1. flesch reading ease range (different range for different age  groups)
2. active voice for e-book (word alert and key terms section seprately in ebook)
3. british english is preferred (s instead of z)
4. don't use e.g, instead use  example.
5. flow (title, table of content, learning objectives (bloom taxonomy class 6 vanda mathi chai bloom's taxonomy, tarw class 4, 5 ko lagi  chai learning objectives haru question form ma huda pani hunxa), chapter introduction (context building part, icebreaking), key terms vs word  alert(key terms chai technical terms ko lagi, general understanding words ko lagi chai word  alert), nepali examples as much as possible, for currency as well use nepali rupees.
6. formatting(use color, sentence case (Advangtage of smartphones/Advantages of Smartphones) first example is  correct.) (no space after colon), (use words for 1-10 numbers, for rest of the number 20/30/40 will  do, but for 1-10, use one, two, three, five).
7. binary music, step-by-step sequencing, 


### learning outcomes framework 

I NEED YOU TO CRAFT THE LEARNING OUTCOMES FOR THE ROBOTICS AND INTELLIGENT SYSTEM COURSE.
I HAVE DIVIDED THE COURSE INTO 7 UNITS, 48 LESSONS WITH THE CORRECT FLOWS OF THE CONCEPT. 
USE FLESCH READABILITY EASE SCORE OF AROUND 60-70. 
BRITISH ENGLISH IS PREFERRED.
YOU NEED TO GENERATE 4 DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE TABLE, 
COGNITIVE LEARNING OUTCOMES, TECHNICAL LEARNING OUTCOMES, PROBLEM SOLVING SKILLS AND SOFT SKILLS. 

>SAMPLE OF HOW TO WRITE THE LEARNING OUTCOMES IS GIVEN IN THE ATTACHED IMAGE AND BELOW SAMPLE AS WELL: 

* USE BLOOM VERBS FOR COGNITIVE PART. 
* TECHNICAL PART SHOULD BE ALIGNED WITH PSYCHOMOTOR SKILL TAXONOMY
* PROBLEM SOLVING SKILLS PART SHOULD BE ALIGNED WITH DESIGN THINKING PROCESS (FIVE STATGES: EMPATHIZE, DEFINE, IDEATE, PROTOTYPE AND TEST) AND SEPRATELY PROVIDE THE ALTERNATIVE 3C PROBLEM SOLVING FRAMEWORKS. 
* VERB SELECTION FOR PROBLEM SOLVING SKILLS SHOULD BE MORE RELEVANT AND ACADEMIC (WORDS LIKE FRAME, RECOGNIZE, SUGGEST THESE AREN'T VERY CONCRETE WORDS, ARE THEY? SOLVE, CLASSIFY, JUSTIFY AND MORE VERBS LIKE THESE ARE MORE WELCOMED. 
* AND SOFT SKILLS PART SHOULD BE ALIGNED WITH CASEL SOCIAL EMOTIONAL FRAMEWORK. 
* DON'T EXPLICITLY MENTION THE FRAMEWORKS NAMES IN THOSE LEARNING OUTCOMES, ALSO GENERATE 3 LEARNING OUTCOMES FOR EACH ASPECTS (4/5 FOR PROBLEM SOLVING (PSYCHOMOTOR AND DESIGN THINKING PROCESS FRAMEWORKS)
* ALSO REMEMBER THE *COLLABORATE* IN SOFT SKILLS SHOULD NOT BE PRIORITIZE AS THE ONLY SINGLE STUDENT CAN BE TAKING THIS COURSE AS WELL INSTEAD OF GROUP AND VICE VERSA SO ADD ALTERNATIVE FOR SUCH CASE AS WELL. 
ONE LESSON AT A TIME, FOR NOW I HAVE PROVIDED YOU LESSON 1.1 SO GENERATE THAT FOR THIS THEN I WILL PROVIDE YOU NEXT LESSON IN SAME STRUCTURE.

SAMPLE LEARNING OUTCOMES THAT IS MADE FOR CLASS 9: IMAGE AND VISION  

CHAPTER 1:  FOUNDATIONS OF VISION 

LESSON 1.1:  VISION AND IMAGE 

DURATION: 1 HOUR 

LEARNING OUTCOMES 

Cognitive 

a. Define what an image is and its role in vision.  

b. Differentiate between discrete and continuous signals 

c. Explain key components of digital images: pixels, channels and color values.  

Technical 

a. Create a simple grid-based representation of an image using paper and pencil.  

b. Convert basic color codes (RGB/HSV) to grayscale or binary formats 

Problem Solving Skills 

a. Analyze how changes in pixel resolution affect image quality.  

b. Troubleshoot common issues in image capture (blurriness and lighting)  

Soft Skills 

a. Collaborate in groups to compare human and robotics vision, sharing observations. 
*****
DON'T GENERATE THE LEARNING OUTCOMES FOR THIS THAT, I WILL PROVIDE YOU EACH LESSON AT ONCE, YOU GENERATE THE LEARNING OUTCOMES THEN IN THE CORRECT FORMAT I HAVE MENTIONED ABOVE. 
I WILL PROVIDE YOU THE LESSON FROM 1.1 TO LAST LESSONS AFTER THIS CHAT, FOR NOW JUST TELL ME DO YOU UNDERSTOOD THE INSTRUCTIONS?
