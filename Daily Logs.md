Ielts completed a reading test with the score of 32/39 which falls inside the band 7 or 7.5 i think.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | We need validation for  the correctness of  the results produce by the model and we are testing that we can test two different models of same size around 8b-12b which can be fit inside the 4090ti and validate how the reslts of those models are similar, similar one gets pass the validation, unsimilar will  requires human's interference to validate. Also including csv file, we can provide a html file containing the image and the text extracted by the model in json  format which will also ease the validation process of human. | 1. requires testing the vlm models for ocr extraction, model sizes ranging from 3b-12b. some mentions are models from like glm, cpm-vl, qwen.<br><br>2. also the orientation of the image is very crucial for the model, we found out  the results from the images that were correctly extracted but the bad orientation resulted by bad results. |
