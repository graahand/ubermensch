fiction only gives truth, philosophy doesn't gives you truth, its just a justification.

Nietzshche, **over-intellectualization** or **decadence** 
```
1. For Nietzsche, instinct (like in animals — direct, decisive, no hesitation) is a life-affirming force.
2. When a person over-analyzes everything, their **energy shifts from acting to just knowing**. The result: hesitation, paralysis, delay.
3. Outwardly, they look civilized, but inside they’ve lost their primal strength (instinct).
4.thinking is important, but **thinking must serve instinct, not dominate it.**
