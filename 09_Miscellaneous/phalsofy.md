fiction only gives truth, philosophy doesn't gives you truth, its just a justification.

Nietzshche, **over-intellectualization** or **decadence** 
```
1. For Nietzsche, instinct (like in animals — direct, decisive, no hesitation) is a life-affirming force.
2. When a person over-analyzes everything, their **energy shifts from acting to just knowing**. The result: hesitation, paralysis, delay.
3. Outwardly, they look civilized, but inside they’ve lost their primal strength (instinct).
4.thinking is important, but **thinking must serve instinct, not dominate it.**

```

1. oedipux  rex, the king (killed his father, married his mother (4 children), then they know and mother hang herself, tragedy between god and people)
2. dionysus, ancient greek god, (balance between apollo and dionysus: )
3. Nietzsche’s idea of the Apollonian vs. Dionysian: 
4. only philosophy is plato, its in our DNA, every philosophy after plato is commentary on plato.
5. Oedipus Complex (son loves his mother and rival his father, subconciously (its psychological and unconscious, not literal))
6. Electra Complex (vice versa to oedipus complex)
7. Metaphysics is like asking **“what is everything really made of, and why does it exist at all?**
