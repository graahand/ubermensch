1. A youtube extension for brave which only allow videos of fixed youtube channels to be there in the home feed (youtube.com) in random order, shuffling between the videos uploaded by those youtubers only, unlike the subscription page in youtube which show only latest videos from subscribed channels. instead the extension should allow adding the youtube channel links and theirs videos should be randomly shown in the home page of my youtube feed.  

	Verdict: not possible because youtube api is required to get the list of the videos from the youtube channels. ani home page jo override garna pani lyang hunxa feri 

	baru web app chai banaunda hunxa but remember api limits eha pani lagxa.

2. But yo extension ko lagi jun jun channel ko videos haru chainxa tesko link collect garna sakiyo vane chai yo kaam ekdam easy hunxa, maybe around 500 links of the videos and then we can build a web app locally or as a extension tarw still, youtube ko homepage override hanne kura chai not that feasible.
