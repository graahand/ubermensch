 ### Conversational Assistant Datasets

1. PersonaChat [bavard/personachat_truecased](https://huggingface.co/datasets/bavard/personachat_truecased)
        Contains 160k dialogue with personality traits. good for **human-like engagement patterns training objective.**
2. Empathetic dialogues [empathetic_dialogues](discarded)

    25k conversations

    for emotional understanding and assistant like behavior development. 

3. BlenderBot3-Dialog [facebook/blended_skill_talk](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/multi-modal-conversation-data)
    
    76k conversations
    knowlege, empathy, personality and consistency. 


### Specific Assistant Behavior Datasets

1. Assistant Conversations by Anthropic [Anthropic/hh-rlhf](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Anthropic/hh-rlhf)

    161k human-assitant dialogues. 
    helpful, harmless and honest response, RLHF-ready format. 

2. OpenAssistant Conversations [OpenAssistant/oasst1](https://huggingface.co/datasets/OpenAssistant/oasst1)

    161k human-generated conversations. 
    include multiple languages (might contain nepali as well)


### Nepali TTS Development

### InternLM-Math [internlm/internlm2-math-plus-7b](https://huggingface.co/internlm/internlm2-math-plus-7b)

7b and 20b models which are pre-trained with ~100B math-related tokens and *SFT* with
~2M bilingual math supervised data. 

{{minhash and exact number match used for decontaminate possible test set leakage.}}

InternLM-Math is solver, prover, verifier and augmentor. 

It was evaluated for formal math reasoning with this evaluation set [MiniF2F-test](https://github.com/openai/miniF2F)

the dataset contains maths problems (theorem proving) from olympiads as well as high-school and undergraduate maths classes. 


In informal maths reasoning MATH, MATH-Python and GSM8K are used as evaluation set. 

InternLM-Math-7b performance: **34.6, 50.9, 78.1**

the 7b model outperforms the deepseek-7b-rl model 


InternLM-Math will be combined with Lean 3 (for theorem proving and maths problem solving). 

[Lean 3](https://lean-lang.org/doc/reference/latest/Elaboration-and-Compilation/) is a interactive theorem prover and functional programming language  based on dependent kernel theory which means types can depend on terms, enabling expressive formalization of mathematics and programs

#### How does test-set leakage happens?

future data used for training in time series. 

and improper cross-validation and its repeated use during hyperparameter tuning. 

information from test fold influence the training process of the model causing data leakage. 



## Mixture of Experts
    a machine learning architecture where llm is divided into multiple networks called experts and the **gated network** dynamically selects and routes input to one or few relevant experts. 

    Models like Mixtral-8x7b, Youtube Recommendation system, Z-code, Switch Transformer are based on MOE. 


    Different modes or methods of MOE are Top-k routing, 
    top-1 routing (only one exper per input token), 
    expert choice routing (expert decides which input they can handle best), 
    sparse activation/routing (only subset of experts are activated)

    **Capacity factor** is the hyperparameter that influences how many tokens each expert can handle during training and inference. 


## Xtuner by InternLM

a finetuning toolkit for large language models, it can finetune the 7b models within 8GB V-RAM. 

Supported models are **internlm, mixtral, llama and qwen**. 

QLORA can be used for finetuning InternLM with publicly available datasets. 

For example
```xtuner train internlm_7b_qlora_oasst_e3```

**Python3.10 support**
```conda create -n xtuner_env python=3.10```
``` pip install -U xtuner```

*Deepspeed* module not found. && 

can be installed with ```pip install deepspeed```

encountered another issue

{{ raise MissingCUDqAException("CUDA_HOME does not exist, unable to compile CUDA op(s)")
      op_builder.builder.MissingCUDAException: CUDA_HOME does not exist, unable to compile CUDA op(s)
      [end of output]}}


Above error encountered due to lack of CUDA Compiler, PyTorch install the CUDA runtime but *nvcc --version* checks whether the CUDA compiler is installe or not. 

### [CUDA Compiler Installation](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/#ubuntu-installation)

1. ```wget https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu2404/x86_64/cuda-keyring_1.1-1_all.deb```

2. ```sudo dpkg -i cuda-keyring_1.1-1_all.deb```

3. ``` sudo apt install cuda-toolkit -y```
4. ``` sudo apt install nvidia-gds```
5. ``` reboot ```


Or

1. ```sudo apt install nvidia-cuda-toolkit``` in Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS.

### What is Nvidia GDS packages?

means GPU direct Storage, that enables bypassing the CPU for data path. 
It allow **direct memory access (DMA) transfers between GPU and Storage devices**
