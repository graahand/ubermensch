### practice question 1. 

![[image-4.png]]

##### my answer
the image shows a young couple between a tensed argument. The young man is wearing brown leather jacket, black jeans and a pair of leather boot and a styling wristwatch. Beside him sits a woman with her leg crossed wearing blue jeans, brown jacket and cute Chelsea boots. The seemingly local park is in the background from the bench the couple are seated. Nearby the park, there are huge tree sparsely populated. It appears to be an image of couple arguing about their personal conflicts that occurred in their relationship. There must have been a heated argument between them such that they are in their current posture.
