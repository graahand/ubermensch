### It is important for people to take risks, both in their professional lives and their personal lives. Do you think the advantages of taking risks outweight the disadvantages. 

"Either you wake up and chase your dream or you sleep and keep dreaming."

Risk means doing something that is out of your comfort zone. Doing different from something that is not habitual to you. So, definitely taking risks In every aspect of human life either its professional or personal have some of the demerits but the horizons and number of opportunities it opens are immense which indeed outweighs the disadvantages of taking risks. 

It might feel uneasy to start something that you are not used to. For example, an individual who teaches at primary level English have greate interest, talent and potential in playing football. He is a fast and strong striker. Now for him to leave the teaching job, training hard, sharpening skills, staying discipline and getting professional won't be cup of cake. He will be needed to adapt and thrive taking every situation life throws at him. Things may go wrong because you cannot control everything happening around you except your own actions and your thinking. But what you can do is work with it regularly, get familiar, handles ups and downs and be determined and consistent which will certainly pay off. 

Therefore taking risks in professional life and personal life is natural traits of being human and they definitely leads to something better as compared to not taking risks and stick to the comfort zone for own's welfare.

In an era that often prioritises security and predictability, embracing risk—whether in one’s career or personal choices—may seem reckless. However, I firmly believe that the long-term benefits of calculated risk-taking, such as personal growth, innovation, and expanded opportunities, substantially outweigh the potential downsides of failure or uncertainty.

Professionally, stepping outside established routines can unlock transformative pathways. Consider an individual who leaves a stable but unfulfilling teaching position to pursue a passion for sports or entrepreneurship. While this decision entails financial instability and emotional pressure, it also creates space for talent to flourish. Even if success is not immediate, the process cultivates resilience, adaptability, and self-awareness—qualities that are increasingly valued in a rapidly evolving global economy. Moreover, many of the world’s most impactful innovations, from small startups to scientific breakthroughs, emerged not from comfort, but from the willingness to challenge the status quo.

In personal life, too, risk is often the gateway to deeper fulfilment. Moving to a new country, ending a toxic relationship, or investing emotionally in a vulnerable connection all carry the possibility of pain. Yet without such leaps, individuals risk psychological stagnation. Staying within a comfort zone may offer temporary safety, but it rarely leads to self-actualisation. As the philosopher Søren Kierkegaard noted, “Anxiety is the dizziness of freedom”—a reminder that growth and discomfort are intrinsically linked.

That said, risk-taking must be **calculated**, not impulsive. Recklessness without preparation or reflection can indeed lead to avoidable hardship. However, when informed by self-knowledge and realistic assessment, risk becomes not a gamble, but a strategic investment in one’s potential.

In conclusion, while the path of risk is rarely smooth, it is often the only route to meaningful progress. The disadvantages—temporary setbacks, emotional strain, or even public failure—are not only manageable but often necessary for learning. Ultimately, a life guided solely by caution may be safe, but it is unlikely to be remarkable.

some people belive that professionals such as doctors and engineersshould be required towork in the country where they did their training. Others believe they should be free to work in another country if they wish. Discuss both these views and give your opinion. 

With rapidly growing world and technological advancements, an individual specialised with human body and solving real world problems with innovationare very highly valued. ALthough serving your birthplace where you studied, developed the skillsets is indeed essential and a responsibility being a social being. But I strongly believe that freedom to nurture and sharpening one's skillsets, large exposure and collected experiences will be proven as invaluable assets to their career. 

Professionals from engineering and medical background are the most important pillars of any nation and they substantially influence the development of a nation and well-being of the people as well. Working in same place where you get nourished allow a person to develop social and emotional intelligence. Even if the place and the work is not as financially fruitful as going to developed country, the people from such technical fields must utilize their immense knowledge and experience for the welfare of the people of that place. Qualities such as resilence, empathy and gratefulness are developed subtly on an individual who is willing to invest his expertise to the society's welfare. 

That said, limiting ownself to the potential opportunities that might one can get is also not fully justifiable. In this era of neck-to-neck competition, growing number of peoples and problems, the technical expertise definitely comes handy. These technical jobs are greatly paid in the developed countries and being person he/she definitely needs to aim for such financial freedom to advance in career and pursuing his hobbies as well. Unlike developed countries, most of the countries from Asia have the culture of son/daughter taking care of their parents in their old age, supporting them financially. This cannot be done by staying in the places with limited number of opportunities along with the financial gains. Due to which technical experts from medical and engineering are not only moving to different countries for career advancement, honing one's skillsets but also they are there for financial freedom, supporting the families as well. 

In conclusion, being human being everyone dreamed of getting successfully, being financially stable, travelling around the world, helping the needy, serving the people. And to fulfill these dreams a person must move out of his comfort zone, take a calculated risk to move to different country which will allow him/her to .................

In an increasingly mobile world, the migration of highly skilled professionals—particularly doctors and engineers—has sparked debate over whether they owe a service obligation to their home countries. While retaining talent is crucial for national development, I contend that individuals should ultimately have the freedom to pursue opportunities abroad, provided they do so ethically and with awareness of the broader impact.

Proponents of mandatory domestic service argue that governments heavily subsidise professional education, especially in developing nations. When doctors or engineers emigrate immediately after graduation, this constitutes a “brain drain” that cripples essential services. For instance, in countries like Nepal or Ghana, the loss of trained physicians has left rural clinics understaffed, directly compromising public health. Moreover, professionals who remain contribute not only expertise but also social capital—fostering innovation ecosystems and mentoring future generations in contextually relevant ways.

Conversely, restricting mobility raises ethical and practical concerns. Talented individuals often seek environments with advanced infrastructure, research funding, or professional networks that simply do not exist in their home countries. Denying them this opportunity stifles innovation and may even discourage future students from pursuing these fields. Furthermore, many professionals send remittances that support families and local economies, or eventually return with enhanced skills—a “brain gain” effect. In societies where adult children are culturally expected to care for aging parents, international employment may be the only viable path to financial security for the entire family.

In my view, while the moral case for serving one’s community is compelling, compulsion is rarely effective or just. A more sustainable approach involves **incentivising retention**—through competitive salaries, research grants, and improved working conditions—rather than enforcing legal restrictions. Ultimately, the goal should not be to chain talent to borders, but to create conditions where professionals _choose_ to contribute at home, while those who leave do so as global citizens who remain connected to their roots.

Thus, freedom of movement, coupled with ethical responsibility and smart policy, offers a more humane and productive path forward than rigid mandates.

Some children spend hours everyday on their smartphones. Why is this the case? Do you think this is a positive or negative development?

In this era of technological advancement where social media, AI and digital technology have impacted the life of majority of people. However, I argue that  children spending lot of time on their smartphone can have adverse effects in their cognitive development. 

Smartphones are gateway to digital world. The rise of internet  enabled us to communicate with out closest ones over long distances, booking a flight ticket to ordering food to our doorstep. Nowadays children uses the smartphone mostly for texting messages, sharing memes  and gossiping with internet friends. The socia media platoforms like TikTok and Instagram are well known about the short attention span of human being and developed a short video genre. These short genre video ar especially developed to adapt with the short attention span of childrens and adults which directly affect the screen time of an individual with the smartphone. These kinds of videos, heavy social media usage and addictive gaming habits in children is adversing affecting their cognitive health. Morever, children doesn't seem to get involved in physical activities and socializing which is the major and unmissable part of childhood. 

In hindsight, social media and smartphones cannot be classified as bad. There are plenty of examples where smart phones coupled with the child's determination have brought success. At early age children are very well known about business, digital marketing, e-sports which actually interests them and they excel in those fields as well. Numerous teenager run instagram accounts generating monthly income at scale which might have started from a room, a smartphone and creativity of that child. Nowadays, smartphones have become very powerful device, with the high quality camera, processing power and portability smartphone allow freedom and ease of use. Learning new skills, preparing for the examinations, learning new hobbies are other perks that a children can extract from a healthy use of smartphone. Even if the chance of smartphone affecting children's cognitive aspect, social and emotional intelligence, the opportunities it bring cannot be overlooked. 

To sum up, the use of smartphone for learning and lightweight social media is not bad instead it is highly recommended to get along with a advancing technology but is sustainable way. A child's brain is like a clay so shaping it with qualities like hardwork, competition and resillence is very essential and cannot be obtained with the social media usage only.

Nowadays a growing number of people with health problems are trying alternative medicines and treatment instead of visiting usaul doctor. Do you think this is a positive or negative development? 

With growing number of population and huge-paced urbanization, health related problems are very prevalent in today's world. In search for solution to adversities and medical difficulties, people tend to try different remedies that are not scientifically proven and performed by medical experts. Instead alternative curing practices such as religious rituals, spritual healers and ayurvedic medicine seems to have earned the trust from comon people. I believe instead of solely relying on medical practices, it is not wrong for people to seek emotional support, hope and inner motivation from spritual healers and ayurvedic medicine. In fact in many developing countries, there are observable cases where the health problems are cured with such holistic approach. 

Additionally, in countries like Nepal and Ghana, they don't have good medical infrastructure and services. Large number of people loose their life due to the lack of basic medical services and medicines. There are alot of rural villages where the basic commuting services are unavailable due to which the availability of medicines and health services become more difficult. In such places, people cannot loose their life waiting for experts. Instead they utilise the knowlege and local remedies passed down from ancestors to cure their health problems. When such remedies also don't work then they refer themselves to the spritual healers and shamans to relief themselves from the growing pain. 

That said, it is not that people reject proper medical treatment from qualified professionals, rather in many areas people prefer alternative medication because the healthcare infrastructure is often inaccessible, basic medicines are unavailable and public awareness regarding the medical conditions remains limited. As a result,  serious illness sometimes go untreated causing preventable death. Communicable diseases can spread rapidly putting the health of whole community in risk. Therefore, it is essential that government and local communities work collectively to ensure that everyone has acccess to basic heatlh facility and medical experts are available during serious medical conditions. 

In conclusion, receiving medical treatment from qualified professionals is fundamental right of everyone. However, due to numerous hindrances such as underdeveloped infrastructure, low public awareness and shortage of trained staffs, people are forced to rely on alternative medicine as substitute to the scientific treatment which place their health at high risk. Therefore, it is urgent that govenment, communities and individuals all work together to make healthcare accessible and raise awareness such that the alternative medicine is only used as support instead of complete replacement to medical treatment. 


#### band 7.5
As access to conventional healthcare remains out of reach for millions, a growing number of individuals are turning to alternative therapies—such as spiritual healing, Ayurveda, and traditional rituals—for relief. While these practices can provide emotional comfort and cultural continuity, I believe their use as a substitute for evidence-based medicine poses serious risks, particularly in low-resource settings where preventable illnesses often go untreated.

In many developing nations, including Nepal and Ghana, weak healthcare infrastructure forces communities to rely on traditional knowledge. Remote villages often lack roads, clinics, or even basic medicines—making timely medical care impossible. In such contexts, ancestral remedies and spiritual healers are not merely cultural preferences but practical necessities for managing illness when no other options exist.

However, when alternative practices replace—not complement—clinical care, the consequences can be severe. Untreated infections may escalate into life-threatening conditions, and communicable diseases can spread unchecked through communities. To mitigate these risks, governments must prioritise healthcare accessibility: building rural clinics, training more health workers, and launching public awareness campaigns about when professional care is essential.

In conclusion, while traditional healing offers cultural and psychological value, access to qualified medical care should be a universal right—not a privilege. Until healthcare systems in developing regions are strengthened, vulnerable populations will continue to substitute spiritual or herbal remedies for clinical treatment, often at great risk. Only through sustained investment and education can societies ensure that alternative medicine supports, rather than endangers, public health.
