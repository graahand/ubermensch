Advance RAG (enhancing llm responses with external information)
OpenSPG (open source knowledge graph engine developed by Ant Group.) Semantic-enhanced Programmable Graph (SPG framework) is used for its development. 

1. KAG integrates structured (knowlege graphs) and unstructured (text documents) data into single framework (framework is full set of building  blocks and rules for developing  ****).
2. bidirectional indexing system between textual data and knowlege graphs(A bidirectional indexing system between textual data and a knowledge graph is a method that allows efficient linking and searching from text to the knowledge graph and from the knowledge graph back to the text, enabling quick and direct access to related information in both directions.)
3. Symbolic logic with LLM and multi-hop reasoning ()

Q. What is knowledge graph (contextually in RAG/KAG)?
